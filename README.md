# JS_ButtonProject

<h3 style = "display: inline-block">In this project I made a red button that if ou click it its adds the click counter below by one and holding down the button will consinuslty add to the click counter
The 3 color sliders of red green and blue will change the backgorund color as you change them to match the values that you set along with display the rgb value of the color you have chosen
I added a custom header thats backgroud color would change to something random everytime you click the button</h3> <h1 style = "display: inline-block">Flashing colors warning, if you hold down the button it will continue to change the background color of the header</h1>
